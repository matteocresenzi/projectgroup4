Installation Instructions:
    1. Navigate to find the 'setup.sql' file located in the setup directory. Open this file in a text editor. If you have root access to a mysql server, uncomment the top section that creates a new database. If you are using a VPS or other sort of mysql access, leave this commented out and either run this SQL file or upload it to a web based database management program (such as PHPMyAdmin).
    2. Once the tables have been setup, proceed with putting the web-app files in a directory hosted publicly by an Apache or similarly compatible HTTP server. 
    3. Ensure that PHP version 7.x, or 8.x has been installed on this machine and any applicable web-server modules have been installed properly. 
    4. This web-app uses MySQLi for interfacing with the MySQL database. It will not run properly unless the modules 'mysqlnd' and 'nd_mysqli' are installed on this server.
    5. Lastly, for this app to be able to connect to the database it will require you to edit the 'dbcred.php' file with a username, password, database name, and host connection for the database. You can make this root if you would like, otherwise you can create a dedicated username and password just for use with this web-app. NOTE: There are two iterations of each of these in this file, separated by a simple boolean variable. This was to make it easy to test on local development machines and only have to change one thing when uploaded into production. If your connection fails, check to see which set of variables you edited and what the "$dev" boolean variable is set to.
    6. Enjoy the invaluable data that is avocado price comparisons!
